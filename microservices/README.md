# Garbler microservices

These microservices provide the word substitution functionalities
for the garbling methods.

All the microservices use the [Datamuse API](https://www.datamuse.com/api/)
to find substitutions.

The `substring-replacer-microservice` is written by [`FlintSable`](https://github.com/FlintSable).
